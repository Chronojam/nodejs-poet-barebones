nodejs-poet-barebones
=====================

Barebones blogging platform using nodejs, express and poet.

## To install:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jackgardner/nodejs-poet-barebones.git
    $ npm install
    
## To edit:

What I have provided is a very barebones bootstrap project to get you started.  You will want to make some changes to the following to suit your individual taste/application:

* Your posts are in _posts/ (poet default)
* By default the application uses the excellent semantic-ui for styling, although any custom styles should be placed into style.css


## To run:

    $ node app.js
